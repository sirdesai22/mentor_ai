# MENTOR AI - AI-Powered Gamified Learning Platform

## üöÄ Overview

MENTOR AI is a modern, AI-driven learning platform designed to transform skill acquisition into an engaging and personalized adventure. Users can define skills they want to learn, and the AI generates a customized learning path, including interactive lessons, knowledge checks (MCQs), and eventually, AI-generated games tailored to their goals. The platform focuses on making learning effective, intuitive, and fun.

This project is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user experience.
